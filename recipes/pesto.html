        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe comes from Samin Nosrat's cookbook <em>Salt Fat Acid Heat.</em> I've made pesto many different times in different ways, but this always turns out the best! Toasting the pine nuts and pounding them and the garlic in a morter and pestle makes all the difference.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>2 packed cups fresh basil leaves</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, pounded</li>
                <li>1/2 cup pine nuts, pounded</li>
                <li>3 1/2 ounces parmesan, finely grated</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Roughly chop the basil</li>
                <li>Pour half of the olive oil into food processor, then add basil and the rest of the olive oil</li>
                <li>Pulse food processor until basil has broken down and combined with the oil</li>
                <li>Transfer oil and basil mixture to a bowl. Add pine nuts, garlic, and parmesan a little bit at a time, tasting as you go.</li>
            </ol>

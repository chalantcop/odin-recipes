        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe comes from the cookbook <em>A Modern Way to Cook</em> by Anna Jones. This method of cooking the pasta creates fewer dirty dishes, and the sauce created by boiling everything together is really tasty!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
                <li>1 pound cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
                <li>Zest of two lemons</li>
                <li>7 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 bunch spinach, chopped</li>
                <li>Black pepper</li>
                <li>Parmesan, for serving</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a little over a quart of water to a boil (I like to use an electric kettle for this)</li>
                <li>While the water boils, add spaghetti, tomatoes, lemon zest, olive oil, and salt to a shallow pan large enough for the spaghetti to lay flat</li>
                <li>Pour boiling water into the pan, cover, and bring up to a boil again</li>
                <li>Once boiling, remove lid and continue to cook on high, turning the spaghetti with tongs every so often</li>
                <li>After about six minutes, add spinach. Continue to cook until almost no liquid remains.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve with parmesan.</li>
            </ol>
